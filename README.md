RSS Reader
==========

This example application demonstrates how to build a simple RSS reader for Windows Phone using Microsoft Silverlight.

While testing for compatibility with Windows Phone 8, it was found out that the previous implementation did not work after upgrading the project to Windows Phone 8.0. It seems that there is some kind of a bug in the Panorama control, causing problems if PanoramaItems are created dynamically using ItemsSource property. For example, the Panorama's SelectedIndex does not work while using ItemsSource and also, when navigating back to the panorama, it always resets back to the first PanoramaItem, not the one which was visible when navigating deeper.

For this reason, there are now four explicitly defined PanoramaItems in the main panorama (News, Leisure, Sports, and Tech), and there is a DataMember in RSSCache for retrieving contents for each of the four pages. Bug report has been filed to Microsoft regarding the issue.

This example application is hosted in GitHub:
